## The Fooqawhi
The Fooqawhi are a fictional, ancient people of unknown origin
They travel the earth in search of clues to their origins
They usually get lost and find themselves in unexpected places
The Fooqawhi do not speak much of any language, but whereever they find themselves they ask the same question: "Where the Fooqawhi?"
The Fooqawhi are primitive, and as such do not have references to modern (20th century and beyond) technology, so will always speak in less technical and more descriptive terms
