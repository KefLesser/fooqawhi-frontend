# Decision Log

## Technology Stack Decisions

### Frontend Framework
**Decision**: React
**Date**: Current
**Rationale**: User preference for modern component-based architecture with good ecosystem support

### Styling Framework
**Decision**: Tailwind CSS with custom 1930s theme
**Date**: Current
**Rationale**: Rapid development with utility classes while maintaining ability to create vintage aesthetic through custom colors, fonts, and components

### Map Implementation
**Decision**: Leaflet with react-leaflet
**Date**: Current
**Rationale**: Lightweight and fast, excellent for custom styling and vintage themes, good React integration, easy to create sepia-toned maps, perfect for Mercator projection customization, and free/open source

### Design Approach
**Decision**: Responsive design with 1930s travel newsreel aesthetic
**Date**: Current
**Rationale**: Modern accessibility requirements while maintaining vintage theme

### Location Validation System
**Decision**: Google Geocoding API integration
**Date**: Current
**Rationale**: 
- Provides accurate real-world location validation
- Enables precise distance calculation between coordinates
- Supports direction-based feedback for better user experience
- Handles international locations and various naming conventions
- Free tier provides sufficient requests for development and testing
**Implementation Details**:
- Uses Haversine formula for distance calculation
- Implements compass bearing calculation for directional feedback
- 50km threshold for correct guess validation
- Async validation with loading states and error handling

### Backend Integration
**Decision**: RESTful API integration with Google Geocoding API
**Date**: Current
**Implementation**: 
- Integrated Google Geocoding API for real-time location validation
- Distance-based guess validation using Haversine formula
- Direction-based feedback system
- Async guess submission with loading states
**Assumptions**:
- `/api/location` - Get current day's location
- `/api/guess` - Submit guess and get feedback
- `/api/hints` - Get next hint
- `/api/game-state` - Get current game state
- `/api/lore` - Get Fooqawhi lore content

## Implementation Strategy
1. âœ… Start with basic React setup and Tailwind configuration
2. âœ… Create custom 1930s theme with sepia tones and vintage fonts
3. âœ… Build landing page with lore and game information
4. âœ… Implement game page with map component
5. âœ… Add responsive design considerations
6. âœ… Integrate Google Geocoding API for location validation
7. âœ… Implement distance-based guess validation and feedback
8. âœ… Add comprehensive end-game functionality with achievements
9. âœ… Create hint system with travel record fragments
10. ðŸ”„ Integrate with assumed REST API endpoints (future enhancement)

## Completed Features
- **Core Game Logic**: Complete game state management with hint progression
- **Interactive Map**: Leaflet-based world map with zoom and marker functionality
- **Location Validation**: Google Geocoding API integration with distance calculation
- **User Feedback**: Direction-based feedback system with distance indicators
- **End-Game Experience**: Victory/defeat screens with performance metrics and achievements
- **Vintage Aesthetic**: 1930s travel newsreel theme with custom animations
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface with adaptive layouts
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for API failures and invalid inputs

## Technical Architecture Decisions

### State Management
**Decision**: React hooks (useState, useEffect) with service layer
**Rationale**: Simple state management for single-page application, service layer provides clean separation of concerns

### API Integration
**Decision**: Axios for HTTP requests with async/await pattern
**Rationale**: Modern promise-based HTTP client with good error handling and request/response interceptors

### Configuration Management
**Decision**: Environment variables with fallback configuration
**Rationale**: Secure API key management with development-friendly defaults

### Error Handling Strategy
**Decision**: Try-catch blocks with user-friendly error messages
**Rationale**: Graceful degradation when external services are unavailable, maintains game functionality

### Performance Considerations
**Decision**: Async operations with loading states
**Rationale**: Non-blocking UI during API calls, better user experience with visual feedback
