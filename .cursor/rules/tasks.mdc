This describes how to handle the execution of tasks in [tasks.json](mdc:.cursor/development/tasks.json)

## GENERAL
Always update [tasks.json](mdc:.cursor/development/tasks.json) when asked to analyze files in the /project-information folder
Always update the status of tasks in [tasks.json](mdc:.cursor/development/tasks.json) when asked to execute tasks
If a task indicates it is Complete, but there is more work to do to complete the task create a new follow-up task rather than changing its status 
If a task status is Not Started, update the task when executing
