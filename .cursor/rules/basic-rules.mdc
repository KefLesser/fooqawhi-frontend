    This rule provides basic standards for the application. 
    
    ## General
    All chat should be concise
    Do not make up answers
    Ask questions if clarification is needed, do not infer

## Scope
    This is the front end for an application.  All work does in this repository should be UI related.
    Assume there will be a restful api available for the backend.

    ## Coding Language

    Always use Typescript

    ## Development
    For every request to change behavior, UI or game play that I make in the chat window, update @project-information by either appending, or editing an existing file, or creating a new one to document the changes

 ## Infrastructure

    Use AWS CDK for infrastructure creation
    Prefer serverless resources when possible

    #UI

    The UI should be created using React

 ## Testing
    Use vitest for unit tests
    Use Playwright for end to end tests
    All new code should include unit and end to end tests

## Decisions
    All decisions made via the chat interface should be documented in @.cursor/development/decisions.md
