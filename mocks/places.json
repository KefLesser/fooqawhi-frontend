        "Ah, what a glorious landscape—bare stone hills, carved not by artistry but by neglect, as if the earth itself grew tired of trying.",
        "Truly, the gods must laugh, for here we are invited to trade the open plains for craggy hollows and shadowy alcoves.",
        "Behold the grand innovation: houses stacked upon one another like children's toys abandoned mid-play, each daring gravity to finish the game.",
        "And what a comfort—walls that sweat with the generosity of eternal dampness, gifting us a fragrance of soil and smoke in every breath.",
        "Our gracious architects have provided a city that is less built than scraped, its streets winding downwards as though eager to vanish into the abyss.",
        "Surely no nobler throne exists than these stone burrows, chiselled straight into the cliffside, where man may pretend to be a king while living like a bat."
